Shiny app for tracking antimicrobial resistance trends

**Step 1**: Please download "amr_data.xlsx" and place it in your R workspace

**Step 2**: Download and run "app.R" in your R Studio

**Step 3**: Once the application has been launched, you should select all the filters and then click on the submit button, since the filters are smart, they will be limited based on your previous selections.

Thanks and I look forward to receiving your feedback and ideas
